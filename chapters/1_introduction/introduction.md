# Introduction

In this section, we introduce Data Science, Python and the Jupyter Project.

## Data Science
Data Science is a wide variety of techniques and practices modern companies use today to draw insights and predictions from raw data. A focus of this book will be on Machine Learning techniques, which are the most common applications of data science in modern businesses.

## Python
In this online textbook, we will be primarily using the Python progamming language.
Python is argubly the [world's most popular programming language](http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) and the language most universities use today to teach programming to new students.
Importantly, Python has a growing community of Data Science users, who have created many of the Python libraries that we will use in this book.

That said, it is important to remember that Data Science is language agnostic. So while this book will use Python in its examples, the principals and techniques taught can be implemented in any other programming language.
